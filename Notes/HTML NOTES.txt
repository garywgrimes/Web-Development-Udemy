HTML:

Structures of a Webpage:

To view the source code of any website, just click Ctrl + U or right click and click view page source


<!doctype html> // tells the browser that this is a HTML file
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>

    <meta charset="utf-8" />  //character type
    <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /> //content set
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /> // view port is important for mobile devices
    <style type="text/css">  // this a  style tag... see where the style tag ends
        body {
        background-color: #f0f0f2;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        font-family: "Open Sans", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        
    }
    div {   
        width: 600px;
        margin: 5em auto;
        padding: 50px;
        background-color: #fff;
        border-radius: 1em;
    }
    a:link, a:visited {
        color: #38488f;
        text-decoration: none;
    }
    @media (max-width: 700px) {
        body {
            background-color: #fff;
        }
        div {
            width: auto;
            margin: 0 auto;
            border-radius: 0;
            padding: 1em;
        }
    }
    </style>    
</head>

<body>
<div>   // div is just a division of content
    <h1>Example Domain</h1>
    <p>This domain is established to be used for illustrative examples in documents. You may use this
    domain in examples without prior coordination or asking for permission.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.iana.org/domains/example">More information...</a></p>
</div>
</body>
</html>


<h1> to <h6> are the valid header tags in HTML
// html ingore the line breaks and more than one space.

//To make the spacing of the line smaller use <br/> tag. It is self closing tag.

 <hr/> creates a horizontal line. It is also a self closing tag.

 Text formatting or Text  decoration:

 Use <strong></strong> tag to bold. We no longer use <b></b> tag.

 <em></em> emphasis It makes the text italics.

 <u></u> for underline.

 <strike></strike> to struck through

 Unordered list:
<h2>My favourite foods</h2>
 <ul> // ul stands for unordered list
 	<li>Pizza</li> // li stands for list
 	<li>Burger</li>
 	<li>Wings</li>
 </ul>
 // For unordered list we ge bullet points


 Ordered List:
<h2>My favourite times of a day</h2>
 <ol>
 	<li> bed time</li>
 	<li>lunch time</li>
 	<li>dinner time</li>
 </ol>

 // For ordered list we get the numbers instead of bullet points.


 Images:

 //first get an image ;)

 <img src="images/man.jpg"/> This a self closing tag.
 Here the images is the folder in the location where the index.html is located.

 we can also give the image URL from some where.
 <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/George_Formby_with_the_army_in_France%2C_1940_cropped.jpg/100px-George_Formby_with_the_army_in_France%2C_1940_cropped.jpg">
 Use width and height to control the image size.


 Forms:

 Use the form tags to create forms.
<form>
     <input type = "text" value =" type here kushal"/>

     <input type ="email"> //This email type will automatically validate if the email is valid or not.

    <textarea>My content area tag goes here</textarea>
    //This text area will allow user to input more data.


//This select and the option tag will make the drop down menu
    <select>
        <option>Select an option..</option>
        <option>1</option>
        <option>2</option>
        <option>3</option>
    </select>


// Radio buttons

    <input type = "radio" name ="color"/> Red
    <input type = "radio" name ="color"/> Green
    <input type = "radio" name ="color"/> Blue

    When I use the name attribute and set it to the same thing as all the option then it will only allow to select one of the option only.

    If I do as:
    <input type = "radio" /> Red
    <input type = "radio" /> Green
    <input type = "radio" /> Blue

    Then I can select more than one radio button

//The check box will allow you to select more than one option. Even though you put the name attribute, it will allow you to select multiple options

    <input type = "checkbox"/>Dog
    <input type = "checkbox"/>Cat
    <input type = "checkbox"/>Finish

//submit the form

    <input type ="submit" value ="Submit this form Kushal"/>
    This will use the get method by  default the submit the form. Once you click the submit method it will put a ? in the URL. It will send all the variables from the form in the form of String.

    When you put the name attribute in the form items that means you can submit it.
    For instance:
    <input type ="text" placeholder="enter address .." name = "address">
    Then when I click submit, the URL will appear as
    file:///C:/Users/Kushal/Documents/Udemy%20Course/The%20Complete%20Web%20Developer%20Course/My%20Websites/1.%20HTML/index.html?address=1408+

    we can see that there is ?address = 1408
    Here the address is from the name field and the 1408 is the value I entered in the client side.

    JavaScript and Php can iteract with the values submitted from any webpage.


</form>


HTML links:
We use <a> tag
  <a href="http://www.google.com">Google...</a> <br/> //external link
<p> <a href="http://www.google.com">Google...</a></p> //external link
<p><a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld internal link</a></p> //internal link

Back to top link:
In the long webpage, when we need to go to the top of the webpage or some certain section we can use the link method to go there.

At the top of the body we can put the anchor like,
<a name ="top"/> This is a self closing tag

Then say, at the bottom, we can link it to the top as
<p><a href="#top"> Go back to top...</a><p/>



HTML Tables:

    <table>
      <tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th><th>Gender</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Kushal Pradhan</td><td>26</td><td>Male</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Aman</td><td>25</td><td>Male</td></tr>
    </table>

tr is the table row
th is the table heading
td is the table data

HTML Entities:

If I want to show <a>, or any special character, appear in the webpage, we need html entities. HTML entites always start with & and end with ;

&lt;a>   will display  <a> in the webpage.

In html you cannot simply give more than one space in the webpage, we need to use html entities for that.
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 will create 3 spaces between 1 and 2 in the webpage.

To find the html entites, google html entities and go to the link of w3schools.com to find more

HTML IFRAME:
How to embed content from another webpage into your webpage?
    We use <iframe> tag

    <iframe src="helloworld.html"></iframe>

This is exactly how you can put the contents of the youtube videos in your webpage.
If you see in the youtube video they have the embed option that gives you the iframe code that you can copy to your webpage.
However, we cannot test locally because, now we are using the file protocal instead of http  (See the URL). To test the http iframe, go to codeschool.com


<form action =" http://space-facts.com/earth"/>
<input type="submit" value="Click Here !"/>
</form>
Here the target will set where the form will go when we hit submit. In this case it is set to go to a web page.

HTML: putting it all together

<a href="MyWebsite.html"></a>
