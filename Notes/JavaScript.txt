The prompt & Some Basic Numbers:
> The JavaScript prompt aka console
 What gets returned from the code is after the arrow.

 JavaScript automatically recognize numbers (positive and negative) and can do the common operations like +,-,/, %.
 It also does the operations in the BODMAS  (PEMDAS) rule.

 Comparators:
 Returns the boolean value.
  > 6>4 will return true

  > 3==4 will return false
  >12!=4 will return true
  > 8>=3 will return true

  Strings:
  Need to use Quotations

  "Kushal"
  can use + to concatenate the Strings
  "Kushal" + " Pradhan"

  \t will give one tab

  "Kushal\tPradhan" will give Kushal	Pradhan
  \" for Quotations. These are the escape sequence
  \\ to produce one \
  \n is the new line

  String Comparisions:

  "Kushal"=="Kushal"
  true

  JavaScript is case sensitive, so "Kushal"=="kushal" will return false

  "kushal".length will return 6
  "k p".length will return 3 // counts the spaces as well

  Variable Discovery:

  var is the Variable keyword.
  var train =3

  train will return 3

  No spaces in the Variable names
  No Variable name should start with a numbers
  Use of underscore  and dollar sign is permitted.
  Use CamelCase for the Variable name.

  Changing Variable Contents:

  var kp = 3
  kp = 4 // reassigning the kp with 4; no need to declare the var again
  kp+=3 is also allowed
  kp++ and kp-- is allowed

  We can store the numbers as well as the Strings in the var

  var sentence ="Kushal Pradhan"
  sentence.length will return 14

  sentence.charAt(1) will return K

  

  Script Tags:

  <html>
  <head>
  <script src="kushal.js"></script>
  </head>
  and so on..

  We can use the simple notepad to write the JavaScript files in the format .js

  The .js files needs to be in the same directory as the index.html file.
  To organize all the script file we can create a folder called scripts and store all the JavaScript files
  And in the HTML script we can say, <script src="scripts/kushal.js"></script>

  Suppose we have a folder for the html files. Lets say all the webpages files are in the root directory and there is two folders 
  called pages and the scripts which contains the index.html and the kushal.js files respectively.

  Then the script will look like
  	<script src="../scripts/kushal.js"></script>
  The .. notation tells to go one directory up i.e, root and then go the the scripts folder and finally find the kushal.js file

Enter the semicolon after the end of the statements

var day = 4;
console.log("Hi there, today is "+  day + " day of the month.");

This console.log() will give the output /print to the browser.
To see the output in the console, we need to go the web console or click ctrl+Shift+K
