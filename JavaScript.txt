The prompt & Some Basic Numbers:
> The JavaScript prompt aka console
 What gets returned from the code is after the arrow.

 JavaScript automatically recognize numbers (positive and negative) and can do the common operations like +,-,/, %.
 It also does the operations in the BODMAS  (PEMDAS) rule.

 Comparators:
 Returns the boolean value.
  > 6>4 will return true

  > 3==4 will return false
  >12!=4 will return true
  > 8>=3 will return true

  Strings:
  Need to use Quotations

  "Kushal"
  can use + to concatenate the Strings
  "Kushal" + " Pradhan"

  \t will give one tab

  "Kushal\tPradhan" will give Kushal	Pradhan
  \" for Quotations. These are the escape sequence
  \\ to produce one \
  \n is the new line

  String Comparisions:

  "Kushal"=="Kushal"
  true

  JavaScript is case sensitive, so "Kushal"=="kushal" will return false

  "kushal".length will return 6
  "k p".length will return 3 // counts the spaces as well

  Variable Discovery:

  var is the Variable keyword.
  var train =3

  train will return 3

  No spaces in the Variable names
  No Variable name should start with a numbers
  Use of underscore  and dollar sign is permitted.
  Use CamelCase for the Variable name.

  Changing Variable Contents:

  var kp = 3
  kp = 4 // reassigning the kp with 4; no need to declare the var again
  kp+=3 is also allowed
  kp++ and kp-- is allowed
