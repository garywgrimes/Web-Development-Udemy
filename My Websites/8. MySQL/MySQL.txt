Went to the cpanel and clicked on the MySQL icon, created a username and password and then clicked manage on it.

User name: kushaldb
PW: hbyWe!.NC


Generated user name and password:
UN: cl21-a-wordp-9cj 	
PW: tq2EV^cbr
Server: 79.170.40.229 * 

Then we have phpMyAdmin program (admin program written in php) that allows us to edit the database.
Database is pretty much collection of tables.

Click on the name of the database that you just created. It should be pretty much empty. Then create tables, should have table name and can also enter the number of columns that you want to have. Be sure to hava atleast one id and make it primary and check the AI(Auto increment) if you need.
Then click on the name of the table you created and click on the insert button the add values.
The auto generated query will look like this:

INSERT INTO `cl21-a-wordp-9cj`.`Users` (`Name`, `Email`, `Password`, `id`) VALUES ('Kushal', 'kushal.pdn@gmail.com', 'test', NULL);

By clicking on the Browse tab, you should be able to see the data you just entered.




Connecting to a database:
Connected to the server using the fireftp and created a folder called MySQL (inside the public_html) and inside that created a file called index.php


<?php 
	mysqli_connect("localhost", "cl21-a-wordp-9cj", "tq2EV^cbr","cl21-a-wordp-9cj");
	echo "Working";
 ?>

 This piece of code helps to connect to the database. 
 Localhost: I can put IP address of the server as well but, since the database is in the same server as every thing else, we can say localhost. The good thing about the local host is that even though the IP address change, it shouldn't be a problem.

 cl21-a-wordp-9cj: this is the user name
 tq2EV^cbr: this is the password
 cl21-a-wordp-9cj: this is the name of the database schema.

 If the connection is established, then it should display the echo command's string. Insted of just displaying the string on the echo command, I can do like
 echo mysqli_connect_error();
 This will display the error message if any. But not a good idea to display the error message publicly, so we can do like:

 if(echo mqsqli_connect_error()){
 echo "Couldn't connect to the database kushal babu"
 }


 Retriving data from database:
 When we couldn't connect to the database, then it is good to stop all the scripts beyond that and the way to do it is:

 <?php
 mysqli_connect("localhost", "cl21-a-wordp-9cj", "tq2EV^cbr","cl21-a-wordp-9cj");
 if(mysqli_connect_error()){
 die("Couldn't connect to the database");
 }
echo "hello";
 ?>
 Here hello will not be displayed.


 <?php
 $link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "cl21-a-wordp-9cj", "tq2EV^cbr","cl21-a-wordp-9cj");
 	if(mysqli_connect_error()){
 	die("Couldn't connect to the database");
 	}
	
	$query = "SELECT * FROM Users";
	if(mysqli_query($link, $query)){
		echo "It worked";
	}
	else{
		echo "It failed";
	}

 ?>

  <?php
	$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "cl21-a-wordp-9cj", "tq2EV^cbr","cl21-a-wordp-9cj");
 	if(mysqli_connect_error()){
 	die("Couldn't connect to the database");
 	}
	
	$query = "SELECT * FROM Users";
	if($result=mysqli_query($link, $query)){ // this will return boolean; the command is mysqli_query(linkdata, querydata)
		$row=mysqli_fetch_array($result);    // this will contain a array of data from the query ($result); the command is 												mysqli_fetch_array
		print_r($row);						 // this will just display the result
	}
	else{
		echo "It failed";
	}
 ?>




 Adding data to a database:
  <?php
 $link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "cl21-a-wordp-9cj", "tq2EV^cbr","cl21-a-wordp-9cj");
 	if(mysqli_connect_error()){
 	die("Couldn't connect to the database");
 	}
	
	$query = "SELECT * FROM Users";
	if($result=mysqli_query($link, $query)){
		$row=mysqli_fetch_array($result);
		print_r($row);
	}
	else{
		echo "It failed";
	}

	$query="INSERT INTO `Users` (`name`, `email`, `password`) VALUES ('Rob Percival', 'rob@test.com','hellothere')";
	mysqli_query($link,$query); // this command is to run the query command.
 ?>




Updating the data that's already there:
$query ="UPDATE `Users` SET `email` ='update@gmail.com' WHERE `id`=3 LIMIT 1";  //limit will limit the number of changes to 1
mysqli_query($link,$query);





Looping through the data:

 <?php
 $link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "cl21-a-wordp-9cj", "tq2EV^cbr","cl21-a-wordp-9cj");
 	if(mysqli_connect_error()){
 	die("Couldn't connect to the database");
 	}
	
	$query = "SELECT * FROM Users";
	if($result=mysqli_query($link, $query)){
		while($row=mysqli_fetch_array($result)){
			print_r($row);
		}
	}
	else{
		echo "It failed";
	}
?>
If you see the source(Ctrl + U), it will be easy to look up. It will be somewhat like:

 Array
(
    [0] => Kushal
    [Name] => Kushal
    [1] => kushal.pdn@gmail.com
    [Email] => kushal.pdn@gmail.com
    [2] => test
    [Password] => test
    [3] => 1
    [id] => 1
)


SO there are two ways to access the data. I can use the column number 0 or the id called Name to access the entry in the first column.

Some queries:
$query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE `name`='Kushal'";
$query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE `email` LIKE '%m%'"; this will list out all the user who has m anywhere in their email.
														  The % on the either side of m, says it can be anywhere.

$query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE `name` LIKE 'k%'"; this will give all the users whose name start with k. Here k is not case 													    sensitive

$query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE `name` LIKE '%l'"; names ending with l

$query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE `id`>3"; where id is greater than 3

$query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE `id`>3" AND `password`!=''"; This will return all the users whose id is greater than 3 and 																		has a password.


$query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE `id`>3" OR `password`!=''";
$query ="UPDATE `Users` SET `name` ='Ian O\'Neil' WHERE `id`=2 LIMIT 1"; // use of escape character

$query = "SELECT `name` FROM `Users`;  This better than SELECT * FROM Users because we can only query what we need.

If I do like: 

if($result=mysqli_query($link, $query)){
		echo mysqli_num_rows($result);
		...


		then this mysqli_num_rows() will give the number of rows that satifies the query.


$query ="UPDATE `Users` SET `name` ='Ian O\'Neil' WHERE `id`=2 LIMIT 1";


	$name ="Ian O'Neil";
	$query = "SELECT `name` FROM `Users` WHERE `name`='".$name."'"
	Problem here is when it hits the '  in the $name its gonna stop.

Solution: $query = "SELECT `name` FROM `Users` WHERE `name`='".mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $name)."'";




Session variables:
session_start(); this is go before any html codes or anything

 <?php
	session_start();
	$_SESSION['loginid']=1;
	echo $_SESSION['loginid'];
 ?>
 then load the page and then delete the $_SESSION['loginid']=1; from the above code and reload the browser, 
 the output will still be there. That variable will stay active unless the user closes all the windows in the browser which are connected to that site.

 Sessions are server specific. So, we can access the session variables from any page which has the session_start() in the php code. This means, if I create a new hello.php file and write the code below:

 <?php
 	session_start();
 	print_r ($_SESSION);
 ?>
 It will give me the value of 1 from the session variable from another file called index.php

 Session variables are good for the logged in session where all the data are removed after the user logs out or something.




Cookies:
If the user wants to stay logged in longer than the browser sessions.
Cookies need to be set before the html code.
 <?php
	setcookie("id", "1234", time()+60*60*24);
 ?>

 	id= key for the cookie
 	1234= value for the cookie
 	time(): time in seconds right now
 	60*60*24 is the number of seconds in seconds which is added to the current time.

Similar to session it can be accessed from other webpage and this time we don't need any session start or cookie start. Cookies are there by default.

Now to get rid of the cookie we can do like:
	setcookie("id","",time()-3600); here to delete the cookie, we don't need to set the value and we can leave it blank and set the time to time in past by doing something like time()-3600; that is cookie is set to expire an hour in past.





Storing Password Securely:

One way of storing password securely is using hash. It is achieved by using the command md5.

<?php
echo md5("HEllo#there");
?>

It will be displayed as d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4. We can store d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4 in our database.
Hackers use rainbow tables to decode the password. It contains the collection of commonly used password which are encoded using the md5 encoding.
Example website: crackstation.net can easily decode d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4 as qwerty. Not very strong.


	using salt:
<?php
$salt ="176dv7b7bndnd3dn83n98";
echo md5($salt."qwerty");
?>

here $salt contains any random combination of numbers and letters.


Using different salt every time for each user:

<?php
echo md5(md5($row['id'])."qwerty");
?>

here we are taking the id of the user and hashing that using md5 and appending that to the actual password and hashing it again.
This is the most secure way to store the password and always use this method. Here the salt is gonna be different every time.
Crackstation.net only works for "unsalted" hashes.












Secret Diary:
People can make account in the website and keep a secret diary that only the user can have access to.

First we will make a simple login system.

SQL injection: Use mysqli_real_escape_string when ever the user has to enter some data and you use that data to connect to and query the database.


Part 1 to create a user and insert it in the database:

<?php
	if ($_POST['submit']){

	if(!$_POST['email']) $error.="<br />Please enter your email.";
	else if (!filter_var($_POST['email'],FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) $error.="<br />Please enter a valid email.";

	if(!$_POST['password']) $error.="<br />Please enter your password.";
			else {
					if (strlen($_POST['password'])<8) $error.="<br />Please enter password with atleast 8 characters.";
					if (!preg_match('`[A-Z]`', $_POST['password'])) $error.="<br />Please include atleast one capital letter.";
				}
	if($error) echo "There were errors in your sign up details: ".$error;
	else{
			$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "cl21-secertdb", "sGb7b7^Jn","cl21-secertdb");
		 		if(mysqli_connect_error()){
			 		die("Couldn't connect to the database");
			 		}
				$query = "SELECT `email` FROM `users` WHERE `email`='".mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $_POST['email'])."'";
				$result=mysqli_query($link, $query);
				$results=mysqli_num_rows($result);

				if($results)echo "The email has already in use. Do you want to login?";
				else{
					$hashedvalue= md5(md5($_POST['email']).$_POST['password']);
					$query="INSERT INTO `users` (`email`,`password`) VALUES ('".mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $_POST['email'])."','$hashedvalue')";
					mysqli_query($link,$query);
					echo "<br/>You have been signed up";
				}
													
			}
			
}

?>

<form  method="post">
	<input type="email" name="email" id ="email"/>
	<input type="password" name="password"/>
	<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Sign Up"/>
</form>


__________________________________________________________________________

Part 2 adding on to the part 1:

mysqli_insert_id in the session will give the id of the most recently added user.

addslashes will handle all the issues with quotes and backslasahes if any.

<?php
	session_start();
	$link = mysqli_connect("localhost", "cl21-secertdb", "sGb7b7^Jn","cl21-secertdb");
	if ($_POST['submit']=="Sign Up"){

	if(!$_POST['email']) $error.="<br />Please enter your email.";
	else if (!filter_var($_POST['email'],FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) $error.="<br />Please enter a valid email.";

	if(!$_POST['password']) $error.="<br />Please enter your password.";
			else {
					if (strlen($_POST['password'])<8) $error.="<br />Please enter password with atleast 8 characters.";
					if (!preg_match('`[A-Z]`', $_POST['password'])) $error.="<br />Please include atleast one capital letter.";
				}
	if($error) echo "There were errors in your sign up details: ".$error;
	else{
		 		if(mysqli_connect_error()){
			 		die("Couldn't connect to the database");
			 		}
				$query = "SELECT `email` FROM `users` WHERE `email`='".mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $_POST['email'])."'";
				$result=mysqli_query($link, $query);
				$results=mysqli_num_rows($result);

				if($results)echo "The email has already in use. Do you want to login?";
				else{
					$hashedvalue= md5(md5($_POST['email']).$_POST['password']);
					$query="INSERT INTO `users` (`email`,`password`) VALUES ('".mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $_POST['email'])."','$hashedvalue')";
					mysqli_query($link,$query);
					echo "<br/>You have been signed up";

					$_SESSION['id']=mysqli_insert_id($link);
					print_r($_SESSION);
					//Redirect to the logged in page.
				}
													
			}
			
		}
		if ($_POST['submit']=="Log In"){
			$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email ='".mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $_POST['loginemail'])."' AND password='".md5(md5($_POST['loginemail']).$_POST['loginpassword'])."' LIMIT 1";
			$result=mysqli_query($link,$query);
			$row=mysqli_fetch_array($result);
			if($row){
				$_SESSION['id']=$row['id'];
				print_r($_SESSION);
				//redirect to the logged in page
			}
			else{
				echo "Couldn't find the user with this email and password. Please try again";
			}
		}

?>

<form  method="post">
	<input type="email" name="email" id ="email" value="<?php echo addslashes($_POST['email']);?>"/>
	<input type="password" name="password" value="<?php echo addslashes($_POST['password']);?>"/>
	<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Sign Up"/>
