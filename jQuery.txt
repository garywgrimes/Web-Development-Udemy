DOM is the document object model which is a tree like structure created by browsers so we can quickly find the HTML elements using javascript.
Inside the DOM, HTML elements becomes "nodes" which have relationship with one another.
JavaScript gives developers a language to interact with the DOM.
Each browser has slightly different DOM structure.
If javaScript uses jquery to interact with the DOM, then it will work on most mordern browsers.

jQuery(<code>); is the jQuery function.

jQuery("h1"); is equivalent to $("h1");
jQuery("p"); is equivalent to $("p");

We can use the CSS selectors in the jQuery.

Fetching an element's text:
$("h1").text();

Modifying an element's text:
$("h1").text("Hello there..");

We need to make sure that the DOM has finished loading the HTML content before we can reliably use jQuery.

So, listening for document ready:

jQuery(document).ready(function(){
	<code>
});


jQuery(document).ready(function(){
$("h1").text("Hello there..");
});


How get the jQuery to my webpages?
1. Go to www.jquery.com and download the jQuery.
2. Load it in your HTML document using the script below:
	<script src ="jquery.min.js"> </script>
3. TO use the jQuery create another file called application.js and include that inside your HTML as
	<script src ="application.js"> </script>
